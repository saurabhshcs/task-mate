Success! 
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

- Starts the development server.
  `npm run dev`
- Builds the app for production.
  `npm run build`
- Runs the built app in production mode.   
  `npm start`
- We suggest that you begin by typing:
  'cd task-mate' and then `npm run dev`
  
> Configuration needed to install Next.js and TypeScript for the project.
  - Create any project folder where you need to run following commands: 
    `npx create-next-app --use-npm` (Why I use `--use-npm` because I have `yarn` installed on my system i.e. another build dependencies tool)
  - Above command will show a message as ` What is your project named? â€¦ my-app` here you need to give your application name for us this is `task-mate`.
  - Now, we need to install `TypeScript` so need to execute following command according to your node version. I'm using node `v14.17.6`
    `npm i -D typescript @types/react @types/node@14` and then create a file `tsconfig.json` in root directory i.e. inside `task-mate`
